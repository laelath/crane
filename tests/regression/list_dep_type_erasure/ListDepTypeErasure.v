(* Minimal reproduction of a codegen bug in the default [list] representation.

   A record with a [Type]-valued field ([carrier]) and a field whose type
   depends on it ([contents : list carrier]) erases [carrier] to a promoted
   type parameter.  When such a value is built at a concrete instance in a
   MONOMORPHIC (non-template) context (the global [d] below), the [list carrier]
   field is emitted with the promoted type variable left unsubstituted, e.g.

     static inline const dyn d = dyn{List<T1>::cons(1, ...)};
                                           ^^ 'T1' is not declared here

   which fails to compile with "use of undeclared identifier 'T1'".  The
   element type should either be substituted with the concrete instance
   ([uint64_t]) or erased to [std::any], matching how the surrounding record
   field is erased.

   This is the same defect that blocks extracting a list-heavy program (e.g. a
   parser whose grammar entries are dependent pairs carrying list-typed semantic
   values) to the default [Datatypes::List<T>] representation. *)
