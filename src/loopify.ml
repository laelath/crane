(** {1 Loopify Pass: Recursive-to-Iterative Transformation}

    Transforms recursive MiniCpp functions and methods into iterative equivalents
    using while loops and explicit stacks. This eliminates C++ stack recursion,
    enabling safe execution of deeply recursive algorithms extracted from Coq.

    {2 Motivation}

    Coq programs often use deep recursion (e.g., structural recursion on large
    trees or lists). Direct translation to C++ would cause stack overflow on
    large inputs. The loopify pass converts recursion into iteration, using:
    - Shadow variables for tail recursion
    - Explicit [std::vector] stacks for non-tail recursion
    - Typed frame structs with [std::variant] dispatching

    {2 Supported Recursion Patterns}

    {3 Tail Recursion}
    [f x = if base(x) then result else f(next(x))]

    Converted to [while] loop with mutable shadow variables. No stack needed
    since no work happens after the recursive call.

    {3 Non-Tail Recursion (Single Call)}
    [f x = if base(x) then result else combine(x, f(next(x)))]

    Uses explicit stack with [_Enter] and [_Call] frames. The [_Enter] frame
    initiates computation; [_Call] frames save continuation context.

    {3 Multi-Recursion (2+ Calls per Branch)}
    [fib n = if n < 2 then 1 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)]

    Uses chained [_Call] frames or [_Enter/_After/_Combine] pattern to handle
    multiple recursive calls in the same expression.

    {2 Architecture}

    The pass operates in several stages:

    1. {b Classification}: Analyze function body to determine recursion kind
       (tail, non-tail, multi-call) via {!classify}

    2. {b Transformation}: Apply appropriate strategy:
       - {!transform_tail} for tail recursion → while loop with shadow vars
       - {!transform_nontail} for non-tail → frame-based stack

    3. {b Decomposition}: Break down complex expressions with recursive calls:
       - {!decompose_single_call} for 1 recursive call
       - {!decompose_double_call} for 2 recursive calls
       - {!decompose_all_calls} for N recursive calls

    4. {b Frame Generation}: Create typed frame structs ([_Enter], [_ResumeN], etc.)
       and dispatch loop with [std::visit(Overloaded\{...\}, frame)]

    {2 Decltype Rewriting}

    Frame struct fields with unknown types fall back to [decltype(expr)].  If
    [expr] references lambda-scoped variables that are not in scope at the
    struct definition level, the C++ will fail to compile.  The function
    {!rewrite_field_access_for_decltype} rewrites both plain variable
    references and field accesses to [std::declval<T&>()] forms, making the
    [decltype] expression valid at struct scope.

    {2 Limitations}

    {b Inner Lambdas Calling Outer Functions:} When an inner lambda (from Coq's
    [let fix]) calls the outer function being loopified, the call remains as
    explicit C++ recursion. This is because inner and outer functions have
    incompatible frame types (different [std::variant] types) and cannot share
    a stack. To avoid this, restructure the Coq code so that inner fixpoints
    become top-level self-recursive helpers (possibly with fuel parameters).

    {2 Entry Points}

    - {!transform_fundef}: Transform a top-level function definition
    - {!transform_method}: Transform a struct method
    - {!loopify_decl}: Main dispatch for all declaration types

    - Direct assignments [id = rhs] keep the LHS undereferenceed (the

(** {2 Generic return-statement rewriter}

    The tail-recursion and TMC loopification passes share the same structural
    traversal of [Sif], [Scustom_case], [Smatch], [Sblock], and nested
    [std::visit] lambdas.  They differ only in how they handle [Sreturn]:
    tail recursion assigns [_result] and breaks, while TMC patches a write
    pointer or allocates cells with holes.

    We factor out the shared traversal into a pair of generic rewriters —
    {!generic_rewrite_lambda_return} for visitor-lambda bodies and
    {!generic_rewrite_stmt}/{!generic_rewrite_stmts} for top-level
    statements — parameterised by a {!loop_rewrite_config} record that
    captures the behavioural differences. *)

(** Configuration for the generic inner-lambda return rewriter.

    Two instantiations exist:
    - {b Tail recursion}: [rc_on_other_return] assigns [_result] and breaks,
      [rc_rewrite_if] emits a plain [Sif], [rc_rewrite_match_branch] is
      [Fun.id].
    - {b TMC}: [rc_on_other_return] dispatches on call count (base cases
      patch the write pointer; TMC branches allocate cells), [rc_rewrite_if]
      emits a plain [Sif], [rc_rewrite_match_branch] is [Fun.id]. *)
type loop_rewrite_config = {
  rc_check : call_checker;
  (** Identifies recursive calls.  Returns [Some call_site] for a direct
      tail call, [None] otherwise. *)

  rc_varying : bool list;
  (** Mask parallel to function parameters: [true] = varying (needs a shadow
      variable), [false] = invariant (referenced directly). *)

  rc_shadow_params : (Id.t * cpp_type) list;
  (** Shadow variable bindings [(name, type)] for varying parameters.
      Used by {!make_shadow_updates} when rewriting tail calls. *)

  rc_on_other_return : cpp_expr -> cpp_stmt list;
  (** Emit code for a non-tail-call return ([rc_check] returned [None]).
      - Tail: {!assign_result_and_stop} (return directly).
      - TMC inner: dispatch on call count — base cases patch the write
        pointer and break; TMC branches allocate cells with holes.
      - TMC top: same but appends [Scontinue] after TMC branches. *)

  rc_rewrite_if : cpp_expr -> cpp_stmt list -> cpp_stmt list -> cpp_stmt list;
  (** How to rewrite an [Sif] whose branches have been recursively processed.
      - Tail: [fun c t e -> [Sif (c, t, e)]] — plain [Sif].
      - TMC: also a plain [Sif]. *)

  rc_rewrite_match_branch : smatch_branch -> smatch_branch;
  (** Transform a match branch before recursing into its body.
      - Tail: {!Fun.id} — no transformation.
      - TMC: also {!Fun.id}. *)
}

(** Top-level rewrite configuration.  Combines a {!loop_rewrite_config}
    (used for visitor-lambda bodies) with top-level-specific behaviour. *)
type top_rewrite_config = {
  trc_inner : loop_rewrite_config;
  (** Inner-lambda config for rewriting [std::visit] lambda bodies inside
      top-level [Sreturn] statements. *)

  (** Statements appended after tail-call shadow updates at the top level.
      Empty [[]] for plain tail recursion (control falls through to the
      [while (true)] test); [[Scontinue]] for TMC. *)

  trc_on_other : cpp_expr -> cpp_stmt;
  (** Emit code for a non-tail, non-visit return at the top level.
      Wraps in [Sblock] as needed. *)

  trc_rewrite_branch : smatch_branch -> smatch_branch;
  (** Transform a match branch at the top level.  In practice the same
      as [trc_inner.rc_rewrite_match_branch]. *)

  trc_detect_void_tail : bool;
  (** Whether to detect the void tail-call pattern
      [Sexpr call; Sreturn _] at the list level and rewrite it as
      [Sreturn (Some call)].  Enabled for plain tail recursion; disabled
      for TMC. *)
}

(** Generic inner-lambda return rewriter.

    Walks the structure of a single statement, descending into [Sif],
    [Scustom_case], [Smatch], [Sblock], and nested [std::visit] lambdas.
    Returns a list of statements because the rewritten form may expand one
    statement into several (e.g. a return becomes multiple shadow-variable
    assignments).

    For [Sreturn (Some e)]:
    - If [rc_check e] identifies a recursive call, emits shadow-variable
      updates via {!make_shadow_updates}.
    - Otherwise, delegates to [rc_on_other_return].

    Visit-in-return (a return whose value is a [std::visit] call with
    recursive lambdas) is detected and the visit lambdas are recursively
    rewritten, but only when at least one lambda contains recursive calls —
    if none do, the visit is treated as a plain base-case expression. *)

(** {3 Shadow variable setup}

    Both {!transform_tail} and {!transform_tmc} begin with an identical preamble:
    determine which parameters vary across recursive calls, compute pointer-safety
    flags, derive shadow variable names and types, and build the substitution map.
    This shared preamble is factored into {!build_shadow_setup}. *)

(** Result of the shared shadow-variable preamble for tail and TMC transforms.

    Every field is purely derived from the function's parameters, its body, and
    the call checker — no mutation, no side effects.  The record is consumed
    immediately by the caller to build shadow declarations and substitute
    parameter references. *)

          [const T*] shadows). *)

      (** Substitution list: [(original_id, shadow_id)] pairs.  Applied to
          the function body via {!subst_stmt} so that references to the

}

(** Compute the shadow-variable setup shared by {!transform_tail} and
    {!transform_tmc}.

    Analyses the function body to determine which parameters vary across
    recursive calls, computes pointer-safety flags (whether a parameter can
    be borrowed as [const T*] instead of copied), derives shadow variable
    names ([_loop_X]) and types, and builds the old→new substitution list.

(** Transform a tail-recursive function body into a [while] loop with shadow variables.

    Tail recursion is the simplest loopification case.  Since no work happens
    after the recursive call, we can convert it directly into iteration.

    {b Non-void functions} use a [_continue] guard variable and a [_result]
    accumulator:

    {v
    let rec f x = if base(x) then result else f(next(x))
    →
    T _result;
    auto _loop_x = x;
    bool _continue = true;
    while (_continue) {
      if (base(_loop_x)) { _result = result; _continue = false; }
      else { _loop_x = next(_loop_x); }
    }
    return _result;
    v}

    {b Void functions} (e.g. cofixpoint [spin], [forever]) never set
    [_continue = false] — their base cases exit via [return;] (which becomes
    [Sreturn None]) rather than assigning a result.  So [_continue] and
    [_result] are unnecessary and the loop simplifies to [while (true)]:

    {v
    CoFixpoint forever n := Tau (forever (S n))
    →
    auto _loop_n = n;
    while (true) { _loop_n = _loop_n + 1; }
    return;
    v}

    After rewriting, {!strip_empty_blocks} removes any empty [Sblock]s left
    by tail-call rewrites that produced no shadow updates (e.g. a
    zero-parameter cofixpoint like [spin] whose only recursive call has no
    arguments to update).

   For non-tail recursive functions, we use an explicit stack of std::function
   continuations stored in a vector.

   Single non-tail: each recursive branch pushes a continuation that captures
   the pre-computed values, then updates the loop parameter to the recursive
   argument. After the loop, the continuations are applied in reverse order to
   build the final result.

   Double non-tail: uses a frame-based stack with Enter/Call variants
   and a while loop. See {!transform_nontail}. *)

    next iteration.  This achieves O(1) extra space instead of O(n) frame stack.

(** {3 TMC transformation}

    Converts non-tail recursive functions where the recursive call is wrapped
    in one or more constructors (e.g., [cons x (f xs)] or
    [cons x (cons x (f xs))]) into iterative loops that build the result
    top-down using destination-passing style.

    Instead of an O(n) frame stack, TMC uses O(1) extra space by allocating
    constructor cells immediately with [nullptr] holes, linking nested cells
    together, then filling the innermost hole on the next iteration.

    Single-cell example ([cons x (f xs)]):
    {[
      auto _cell = Cons_(x, nullptr);
      <patch _head/_last with _cell>
      _last = _cell;
    ]}

    Nested-cell example ([cons x (cons x (f xs))]):
    {[
      auto _cell  = Cons_(x, nullptr);   // outer
      auto _cell1 = Cons_(x, nullptr);   // inner
      _cell.tail  = _cell1;              // link
      <patch _head/_last with _cell>
      _last = _cell1;                    // advance to innermost

    resolved via {!Common.lookup_ctor_field_name}, which returns the

(** Generate chained [_AfterN]/[_CombineN] frames for an N-call decomposition within the
    nontail frame-based transformation.

    When a single expression contains N >= 2 recursive calls (e.g.,
    [f(a) + f(b) + f(c)]), each call must be sequentialized into separate stack
    frames. This function creates a chain of N [_CallN] frames:

    - Frames 0..N-2 (intermediate): Each saves partial results from earlier
      calls plus the arguments for remaining calls. Its handler pushes the next
      [_CallN+1] frame (with accumulated partials) and an [_Enter] frame for the
      next recursive call.

    - Frame N-1 (final): Saves all N-1 partial results plus any non-recursive
      saved expressions. Its handler combines all partial results with the last
      [_result] using [acd.acd_combine] to produce the final value.

    The function also emits the initial push statements: push the first [_Call]
    frame (saving remaining call arguments and non-recursive expressions), then
    push [_Enter] for the first recursive call.

(** Emit chained [_AfterN] and [_CombineN] frames for a double-call decomposition.

    When a return expression contains exactly two recursive calls

    stack frames:

    - [_Call1] saves the second call's arguments and any non-recursive saved

      and [_Enter] for the second call.
    - [_Call2] saves the first call's result ([left]) and the non-recursive
      expressions.  Its handler calls [make_final_handler] to combine both
      results.

    The push sequence emitted is [_Call1\{second_args, dd_saved, extra\}]
    followed by [_Enter\{first_args\}].

    [extra_saved] / [extra_types] append additional expressions and their types
    to both frames — used by {!rewrite_enter_stmts} for continuation variables
    that must survive across both calls.

(** Rewrite a single return statement for the [_Enter] handler in frame-based
    non-tail recursion transformation.

    This function is the core of the frame-based rewriting strategy. It analyzes
    return statements and rewrites them into stack pushes when they contain
    recursive calls. The rewriting depends on the number and structure of recursive
    calls:

    - {b 0 calls}: Assign directly to [_result]
    - {b 1 call}: Decompose via {!decompose_single_call}, push [_Call] + [_Enter]
    - {b 2 calls}: Decompose via {!decompose_double_call}, push chained frames
    - {b N calls}: Decompose via {!decompose_all_calls}, push N frames

    Special cases handled:
    - [std::visit] with recursive scrutinee (decompose scrutinee first)
    - IIFEs ([CPPfun_call(CPPlambda(...))] containing recursive calls
    - Nested recursive calls (e.g., [f(x, f(y, z))])
    - Recursive calls in saved frame expressions

    @param ctx  Enter-rewrite context (see {!enter_rewrite_ctx})
    @param stmt The statement to rewrite (typically a [Sreturn] statement)
    @return A list of rewritten statements (frame pushes or result assignments) *)

(** Process a sequence of statements using continuation-passing to handle
    recursive calls in assignment positions.

    This is the core of the nontail frame-based transformation for statement
    sequences. When it encounters [Sasgn(id, ty, e)] where [e] contains one or
    more recursive calls, it captures the remaining statements ([rest]) as a
    "continuation" that is embedded in the Call frame's handler.

    {b Stack frame chaining strategy.}  For [let x = f(a) in rest]:
    + Push [_CallN\{saved_fields\}] — saves continuation variables live across
      the call.
    + Push [_Enter\{args\}] — provides the recursive call's arguments.
    + The loop pops [_Enter], executes the call, stores the result in
      [_result], then pops [_CallN] whose handler binds [x = _result],
      restores saved fields, and processes [rest].

    For nested calls like [let x = f(a) in let y = f(b) in rest], frames
    chain: [_Call1]'s handler processes the [let y = ...] assignment, which
    pushes [_Call2] + [_Enter] for the second call.  The final handler in
    [_Call2] processes [rest].

    The function handles several cases:
    - {b Single direct call}: [let x = f(args) in rest] -- creates one Call
      frame whose handler assigns [_result] to [x] then processes [rest].
    - {b Single decomposed call}: [let x = g(saved, f(args)) in rest] --
      decomposes [e] to extract saved expressions and the recursive call,
      creates a Call frame that reconstructs the expression from frame fields.
    - {b Double call}: [let x = f(a) + f(b) in rest] -- creates two Call
      frames (_Call1 and _Call2) chained together, with the continuation
      embedded in the final _Call2 handler.
    - {b N-call}: [let x = f(a) + f(b) + f(c) in rest] -- delegates to
      {!gen_chained_call_frames} for arbitrary numbers of calls, then patches
      the final frame to include the continuation.
    - {b Non-assignment statements}: delegates to {!rewrite_enter_lambda_return}.

    Continuation variables (free in [rest] but defined before it) are saved in
    each Call frame and restored via [make_cont_bindings] in the handler.

(** Move non-trivial values into explicit continuation frames when ownership is
    already local to the loop dispatcher.

    Frame handlers bind [_f] by moving the active variant alternative out of
    [_frame].  Any non-trivial [_f.field] subsequently saved into another frame
    can therefore be moved instead of cloned.  Likewise, [_result] is used as a
    scratch accumulator and is overwritten by the recursive call whose [_Enter]
    frame is pushed immediately after the continuation frame, so saving it by
    move avoids a deep copy.

    For [_Enter] frame pushes the rule is extended: child pointers dereferenced
    by [CPPderef] (e.g. [*(d_a1)]) are also moved.  These arise from
    [shared_ptr] fields of a value-type variant that has been matched with
    [v_mut()] (after [make_owned_param_matches]), so the pointed-to value is
    mutable and the current iteration is the only owner — moving is safe.

    Value fields bound from owned [v_mut()] matches (e.g. [auto &[a0, a1] =
    std::get<...>(l.v_mut())]) are also moveable: the scrutinee is owned and
    dead after the frame push, so moving the field avoids a deep copy. *)

(** Fix bindings in a continuation frame handler for fields that became
    pointer-safe after [compute_frame_pointer_safe].

    When a frame field is pointer-safe, its C++ type changes from [T] to
    [const T*].  The handler body (generated by [make_cont_bindings] before
    pointer-safe computation) has bindings of the form:
      [T id = std::move(_f.field)]  — invalid: field is [const T*], not [T]
    This function replaces those with a const-reference binding:
      [const T& id = *(_f.field)]   — dereference the pointer (zero copy)

    A reference binding is preferred over a plain pointer copy because:
    - Lambda captures ([=]) copy the referenced value by value (semantics preserved)
    - Method calls ([id.foo()]) work directly without an extra dereference
    - [&id] in pointer-safe push args gives back the original raw pointer

    The subsequent [adjust_frame_push_args] pass then rewrites [_Enter{id}] and
    [_CallN{..., id, ...}] push arguments at pointer-safe positions to [&id],
    recovering the [const T*] that those frames expect.

    Only processes top-level [Sasgn] statements in the handler body, which is
    all that [make_cont_bindings] generates.  Does not recurse into nested
    statement structures (inner lambdas, visitor branches, etc.).

(** Transform a non-tail recursive function body using an explicit frame-based stack.

    Non-tail recursion requires saving continuation context. We use typed frames
    stored in a [std::variant] stack. Each frame captures the state needed to
    resume after a recursive call returns.

    {v
    let rec f x = if base(x) then result else combine(x, f(next(x)))

    becomes:

    struct _Enter { T x; };
    struct _Call1 { T _s0; };  // saves 'x' for combine step
    using _Frame = std::variant<_Enter, _Call1>;

    let f x_init =
      std::vector<_Frame> _stack;
      _stack.emplace_back(_Enter{x_init});
      T _result;
      while (!_stack.empty()) {
        std::visit(Overloaded{
          [&](_Enter _f) {
            if (base(_f.x)) { _result = result; }
            else {
              _stack.emplace_back(_Call1{_f.x});      // save x
              _stack.emplace_back(_Enter{next(_f.x)});  // recurse
            }
          },
          [&](_Call1 _f) { _result = combine(_f._s0, _result); }
        }, _stack.back());
        _stack.pop_back();
      }
      return _result;
    v}

    Frame types:
    - [_Enter]: Captures function arguments (the "call" part of a recursive call)
    - [_CallN]: Captures continuation context (values needed after a call returns)

    The transformation:
    1. Identifies varying vs invariant parameters
    2. Rewrites [_Enter] handler: returns → frame pushes
    3. Collects [_CallN] frame info during rewriting
    4. Generates frame struct definitions
    5. Generates dispatch loop with [std::visit]

    @param fn_name  Optional function name used to annotate the generated
                    [while] loop comment (aids readability of the emitted C++)

(** Try to inline a mutual recursion partner into a function body.

    Scans [body] for calls to functions registered in {!mutual_fn_table} that
    also call back into the current function (true mutual recursion). If such a
    callee is found, its body is inlined at each call site:

    - {b Tail calls} ([return callee(args)]) are replaced by parameter bindings
      followed by the callee's body directly.
    - {b Non-tail calls} ([let x = callee(args) in ...]) are wrapped in an
      immediately-invoked lambda (IIFE) so the callee's body can use [return].

    Parameter names in the inlined body are prefixed with [_inl_] to avoid
    collisions with the outer function's variables. After inlining, the function
    becomes self-recursive (the callee's calls back to the current function are
    now direct self-calls) and can be loopified by {!transform_fundef}.

    Only the first mutual partner found is inlined (at most one level).

    @param names List of [(GlobRef.t, Id.t)] pairs identifying the current
                 function (used to skip self-calls and detect back-calls)

(** {2 Inner lambda loopification}

    inner lambda. Matches [CPPfun_call (CPPvar id, args)] where [id] equals
    [lambda_name]. All matched calls are marked as non-tail since inner lambda
    calls are processed within expression contexts.

    @param lambda_name The [Id.t] name of the lambda variable (e.g., the [id]
                       in [std::function<...> id = ...])

(** Walk through a statement list and loopify any self-recursive [std::function]
    lambda assignments.

    Recognises two patterns for self-recursive lambdas:
    + [Sdecl(id, Tfun _); Sasgn(id, None, CPPlambda(...))] -- declaration
      followed by assignment (common when Coq's [let fix] is extracted).
    + [Sasgn(id, Some(Tfun _), CPPlambda(...))] -- combined declaration and
      assignment.

    For each matched lambda whose body contains recursive calls to [id] (as
    determined by {!lambda_checker} and {!classify}), applies the appropriate
    transformation ({!transform_tail} or {!transform_nontail}). Lambdas without self-recursion are left unchanged but
    their bodies are recursively scanned for nested lambdas.

    Also descends into all nested statement structures (if/else, while loops,
    [std::visit] lambdas, switch, blocks) and into lambda expressions within
    assignments and returns, to find recursive lambda patterns at any depth.

     recursion, reuse {!transform_tail} with a checker keyed on the self-param
     (dropping the trailing self-forward argument so the remaining args align
     positionally with the non-self loop params).  After transformation the
     self-parameter is unreferenced; the {!Cpp_print} lambda printer emits
     unreferenced params without a name, so there is no [-Wunused-parameter].

(** {2 Cofixpoint detection}

    Cofixpoints (corecursive definitions) returning a standard coinductive type
    are wrapped in a [lazy_] thunk by [cofix_wrap] in [translation.ml].  This
    wrapping defers evaluation so the infinite corecursive structure is built
    on demand rather than eagerly.

    {b Why loopification is unnecessary.}  The [lazy_] wrapper means the
    generated C++ function has this shape:

    {v
      shared_ptr<Stream<T>> smap(F f, shared_ptr<Stream<T>> s) {
        return Stream<T>::lazy_([=]() mutable -> shared_ptr<Stream<T>> {
          return Stream<T>::cons(f(hd(s)), smap(f, tl(s)));
        });
      }
    v}

    The entire body — including any recursive calls like [smap(f, tl(s))] —
    is captured inside a [[\=\]] lambda.  When [smap] is called, it {e never
    executes} the recursive call; it just constructs the closure and passes
    it to [lazy_()], which stores it as a thunk.  The function returns in
    O(1) stack frames.  The recursive call is only executed later, when a
    consumer forces the thunk (e.g. via [.v()]).  At that point the original
    call frame is long gone, so there is no stack accumulation.

    Even cofixpoints with multiple recursive calls (e.g. a coinductive tree
    with [Node n (infinite_tree (n+1)) (infinite_tree (n+2))]) are safe: each
    recursive call itself returns a [lazy_] thunk in O(1), so the total stack
    depth when the outer thunk is forced is still bounded.

    {b Why loopification would be incorrect.}  The TMC (Tail Modulo Cons)
    transform patches cons cells in place via [v_mut()], but coinductive
    types store their variant inside [crane::lazy<variant_t>] and expose
    only the immutable [v()] accessor.  Applying TMC to these bodies
    generates invalid C++ that references the nonexistent [v_mut()] method.

    {b Custom-extracted coinductive types} (e.g. [itree] in reified mode)
    bypass the [lazy_] wrapping because [Table.is_coinductive_type] returns
    [false] for custom inductives.  Their bodies are normal (non-lazy) and
    flow through the standard loopification path.

    The post-pass {!loopify_inner_lambdas} is still applied to the full body
    so that any nested [std::function] fixpoints inside the thunk are
    loopified independently. *)

(** Detect a [lazy_]-wrapped cofixpoint body.

    Matches the AST pattern produced by [cofix_wrap] in [translation.ml]
    (lines ~7620--7650 and ~8878--8883).  The pattern is:

    {v
      Sreturn(Some(
        CPPfun_call(
          CPPqualified(type_expr, "lazy_"),
          [CPPlambda([], Some ret_ty, inner_body, capture)])))
    v}

    This appears as the {e last} statement in the function body.  Cofixpoints
    with [let ... in] bindings before the return (e.g. [unfold]) have prefix
    statements before the [lazy_] return, so we check only the final statement.

    For cofixpoints whose body branches (e.g. an [Sif] at the top level),
    [cofix_wrap] wraps each return expression individually, so the last
    statement is the branch, not a [lazy_] return.  In that case we return
    [false] and the function falls through unchanged — this is safe because
    each branch still returns a [lazy_] thunk (no stack growth), and the
    loopify pass would see recursive calls inside lambdas and classify the
    function as [No_recursion], producing no transformation.

    @param body  The statement list comprising the function body.

(** Inline an Equations-style "functional" into its knot-tying wrapper.

    Well-founded recursion defined with [Equations] (or the [Fix]/[Wf]
    combinators) extracts as two sibling definitions: a {e functional}
    [f_functional l rec] that performs the real recursion by calling its
    [rec] parameter, and the tied knot [f l = f_functional l f] that passes
    [f] itself as [rec].  At the C++ level this becomes

    {v
      f(x) { return f_functional(x, [](y){ return f(y); }); }
    v}

    Loopify cannot linearise this on its own: the actual recursion is hidden
    behind an opaque helper and an argument lambda it does not control, so the
    frame transform degenerates into a single [_Enter] loop that just re-runs
    the body.  We repair it {e before} loopification by inlining the
    functional's body into [f], rewriting every call to the [rec] parameter
    into a direct self-call to [f].  The result is ordinary self-recursion
    (here, two non-tail calls combined with [++]) that {!transform_nontail}
    turns into a proper explicit-stack loop.

    Detection is deliberately narrow — the wrapper's body must contain a call
    to a sibling field whose argument at some position is exactly an
    eta-expansion [fun y => f(y)] of the wrapper itself — so only the knot
    pattern is rewritten.  The functional field is left in place (now unused);
    it is a template and instantiates only on demand. *)

(** Hoist recursive calls out of [if]-conditions into preceding let-bindings.

    Loopify's [has_recursive_branch_dependency] guard leaves a function fully
    recursive when a recursive call appears in a branch condition, because the
    frame rewriter cannot keep a move-only cloned subtree alive across the
    branch.  For value-typed results that danger does not apply, and once the
    call is bound to a temporary the condition merely reads a scalar — exactly
    the shape [transform_nontail] already linearises with a resume frame (as it
    does for a recursive [let r := f m in if ... r ...]).

    So, when the return type is trivially copyable, rewrite each
    [if cond[f(x)] then A else B] into [let r := f(x) in if cond[r] then A
    else B].  Binding once also de-duplicates a call that the condition and a
    branch both use.  Only conditions are rewritten (recursive scrutinees are
    already let-bound during match lowering); lambda bodies are not descended
    into, since their calls are not evaluated as part of the condition. *)

(** Transform a top-level function definition by loopifying its body.

    This is the main entry point for loopifying a [Dfundef]. The transformation
    proceeds in four steps:

    + Register the function in {!mutual_fn_table} so that other functions can
      detect mutual recursion with it.
    + Try to inline mutual recursion partners via {!try_inline_mutual_into},
      converting mutual recursion into self-recursion.
    + Classify the recursion pattern with {!classify} and apply the appropriate
      strategy: {!transform_tail} for tail recursion, or {!transform_nontail}
      for the general case (including multi-call patterns).
    + Post-pass with {!loopify_inner_lambdas} to loopify any self-recursive
      [std::function] lambdas nested within the body.

    For cofixpoints returning a coinductive type, the body is wrapped in a
    [lazy_] thunk by [cofix_wrap].  The recursive calls are captured inside
    the closure and never executed at call time, so the function returns in
    O(1) stack frames and loopification is unnecessary.  We detect the
    [lazy_] pattern via {!has_lazy_body} and skip the main loopification
    pass.  See the {!has_lazy_body} section header for the full rationale.

(** Transform a struct method by loopifying its body.

    Methods differ from free functions because recursive calls use
    [this->method(args)] rather than [f(args)]. To loopify, we introduce a
    synthetic [_self] parameter that replaces [this] in the body, allowing the
    loop to track which object is being processed across iterations.

    The transformation:
    + Creates a {!method_checker} for the method name.
    + Classifies the recursion pattern.
    + Replaces [CPPthis] with [CPPvar _self] throughout the body.
    + Adds [_self] (with the struct pointer type) to the parameter list.
    + Applies the appropriate loopification strategy.
    + For tail recursion: initializes the shadow variable directly from [this]
      (no separate [_self = this] line needed).
    + For nontail recursion: prepends [_self = this] initialization before the
      loop, since the [_Enter] frame references [_self] by name.
